				<h1>Lo and Behold</h1>
				<p>In this video Ted Nelson discusses the quote,if at first you don't succeed try, and try again.‚Äù  He doesn't want to be remembered as the guy who didn't try. What I believe he was trying to explain is he didnt want to be someone who falls into social norms of design. He brings up a memory as a child where he's rowing in a boat and he drags his hand in the water. Watching the water morph around his hand. I interpreted this as design is the water and the hand or object is society. Design is forever changing and adapting to its audience. There is no one way to design each situation, client and style will be different.  </p>
