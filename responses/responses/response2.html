				<h1>The Web Designer Exposing the Humanity and Humor of the Internet</h1>
				<p>Jon Lucas talks about humor in design. This relates to Ted Nelson because Jon talks about standing out by using humor to achieve a more “human experience”.  In today's society almost anyone can build a functioning website. But it takes a designer to take that website and make it appealing to use. “You have to have a sense of humor to live with the web, It’s important to keep things light and casual and to remember, at the end of the day, this is just a piece of metal and plastic sitting on your lap.”</p>
