		<div class="question">
			<p> What Gravitates you to a website or design?</p> 
		</div> 

		<div class="answers">
			<p> A professional looking site and a user friendly design that allows for easy navigation of the website's pages, features and menus typically draws me towards a website. </p>

		<div class="question">
			<p> What's makes a good website? ie, interations? click tabs? Colour? </p>
		</div> 

		<div class="answers">
			<p> believe there is no set formula for a good website. But something that can be navigated and figured out by the average person is always a good website. If a site can contain everything to a single page or maintain a consistent theme between pages it's a major plsu. </p>

		<div class="question">
			<p>Do you consider yourself a creative person? </p>
		</div> 
		
		<div class="answers"> 
			<p>Yes, I consider myself a creative person. </p> 
		</div> 
		
		<div class="question"> 
			<p>When do you find your most creative? </p>
		</div> 
		
		<div class="answers"> 
			<p>I find myself to be most creative when I'm put on the spot to make or create something myself. Or when faced with an issue that interrupts an immediate goal and needs to be resolved. </p>
		</div>	 

		<div class="question">
			<p>What kind of design do you gravitate towards? web, books, movie posters etc. </p>
		</div> 
		
		<div class="answers">
			<p>I'm typically drawn towards movie posters and video game advertising as they are two mediums very close to me.</p>
		</div> 
		
		<div class="question">
			<p>If you could take credit for any design what would it be and why? </p> 
		</div> 
		
		<div class="answers">
			<p>I would take credit for the original Star Wars poster as it's an iconic movie poster design that simply works. Apparent through the consistent imitation of the design, even for films as recent as Avengers Endgame. </p>
